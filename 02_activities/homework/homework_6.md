**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous work, I focused on data analysis and technical projects, but I now see how important it is to include ethics and fairness. Moreover, I would make sure that the data I use id diverse and representative, so no group is left out or unfairly impacted by the results.

In addition, I would also check that any models or systems I build are fair and not biased against certain groups. By focusing on transparency and fairness. So, decision made is ethical and benefit everyone equally.
